# Project Goal: 

To provide business stakeholders with an interactive "remote control" for monitoring key sales metrics, analyzing trends, and identifying top-performing areas and products from the Superstore dataset.

# Dataset
**Name:** Sample Superstore Dataset

**Source:** (Typically included with Tableau Desktop, or available online)

**Key Features:** Sales, Profit, Order Date, Region, Product Name, etc.

# Dashboard Highlights & Analysis
This dashboard visualizes key aspects of sales performance, offering immediate insights:

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displays high-level metrics such as Total Sales ($286K), Total Profit ($5,009), and a significant overall value ($2M), providing an immediate snapshot of business health.

**Sales & Profit Trend:** Visualizes monthly trends for Sales and Profit over time (2014-2017/2018).

**Interpretation:** Shows clear seasonality in sales with an overall upward trend towards the end of the period. Profit, while following sales patterns, is much lower in magnitude and more volatile, indicating periods of varying profitability.

**Sales Growth %:** Tracks month-over-month percentage change in sales.

**Interpretation:** Reveals significant fluctuations in growth, including periods of very high growth (e.g., early 2014) and declines, indicating an inconsistent growth trajectory.

**Sales by Region & Profit**: Compares sales performance across different geographical regions.

**Interpretation:** The West region significantly leads in sales, followed by South, East, and Central. This highlights the West as the primary revenue driver and suggests areas where sales efforts might need to be optimized.

**Top 10 Products by Sales:** Identifies the highest-selling products.

**Interpretation:** "Canon ImageCLASS 2200" is the top-selling product by a considerable margin, followed by "Cisco TelePresence Systems" and "Fellowes PB500 Electric Perforator," providing insights into product popularity and revenue contribution.

**Interactivity**: The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter by 'Year of Order Date' and click on regions to dynamically filter the 'Top 10 Products by Sales' chart.

**Tools Used**
Tableau Public: For interactive dashboard design and visualization.
